.. danger ::

  We strongly suggest that you contact the db creator
  (manuel.gigena@kuleuven.be) prior to modifying the scripts,
  parameter or data files. In fact, we discourage updating the master files,
  and suggest restricting the use of the database to:

  * reading the *.csv* files (or the tables in the SQLite db once it's
    deployed), and
  * making new variables and  tables and saving them elsewhere.
