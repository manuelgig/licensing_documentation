The Python files & code
=======================

.. danger ::

  We strongly suggest that you contact the db creator
  (manuel.gigena@kuleuven.be) prior to modifying the *.py* files.

We used python to build the database. All scripts are located in the
folder named *./00_py_scripts*, and we wrote separate scripts for each part of
the database--- i.e., education, experience, construction of tables, web
scrapers, etc--- as well as for functions.

The *.py* files
----------------

The files whose names begin with *<Sxx>* contain the scripts for different parts,
the files whose names begin with *<fxx>* contain functions which are called
from the *<Sxx>* files.

The contents of the *.py* files are lightly documented, but we discourage users
from modifying them in any way.

Updating the database
---------------------

The csv files in the *./04_tables* folder are not updated automatically after a
change in the parameter file (e.g., if you modify the dictionary
files that sort job titles into functional areas by adding new keywords).
There are inter-dependencies between the *.py* files, hence we suggest you
execute them in the following order:

#. S07_matching_company_names.py
#. S01_match_school_names
#. S09_make_tables
#. S14_make_dyads_tables
#. S15_make_documentation_tables
#. S16_ext_1

.. admonition :: Updating the complete db

  The complete db, tables and documentation can be updated at once running
  the *S17_make_be_founders_db.py* file. This executes the *.py* files in the right
  order and with their parameters set at their default value (e.g., the
  thresholds for the fuzzy matching).
